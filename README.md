# Stack Implementation in C++

> A comprehensive stack data structure implementation project created as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course.

---

## 📚 About The Project

This project explores stack data structures through multiple implementation approaches in C++. It includes three different implementations and practical problem-solving applications to demonstrate stack usage in real-world scenarios.

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Approaches

This project contains **three different stack implementations**:

### 1️⃣ Linked List-Based Stack
Custom implementation using linked list structure for dynamic memory allocation.

### 2️⃣ STL Stack
Implementation using C++ Standard Template Library's built-in stack container.

### 3️⃣ Template-Based Stack
Generic custom implementation using C++ templates to support multiple data types.

---

## ✨ Stack Operations Implemented

All implementations support the following operations:

- **push()** - Add element to top of stack
- **pop()** - Remove element from top of stack
- **peek()/top()** - View top element without removing
- **isEmpty()** - Check if stack is empty
- **isFull()** - Check if stack is full (for fixed-size implementations)
- **display()** - Display all stack elements
- **size()** - Get current number of elements

---

## 🎯 Problem Solving

Applied stack concepts to solve **10 classic DSA problems**, including:

- ✅ Valid Parentheses
- ✅ Reverse String
- ✅ Push at Bottom
- ✅ Stock Span Problem
- ✅ And much more stack-based challenges

Each problem demonstrates practical applications of both custom and STL stack implementations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **Concepts:** Linked Lists, STL, Templates, Pointers, Classes

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC, MinGW, or Clang)
- Visual Studio Code (optional, any C++ IDE works)

### Compilation & Execution

**Using g++ compiler:**
```bash
# Compile
g++ filename.cpp -o output

# Run
./output           # Linux/Mac
output.exe         # Windows
```

**Using VS Code Code Runner:**
1. Install Code Runner extension
2. Open the .cpp file
3. Click the ▶️ Run button or press `Ctrl+Alt+N`
